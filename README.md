jsconf-2013-nodebots
====================

Code I toyed with at the NodeBots event at JSConf 2013.

The demos that have videos:

* led-line.js: https://vine.co/v/bYwQQij6E0Z
* led-kitt.js: https://vine.co/v/bYd71QvQ9LQ
* onboard-led-toggle.js: https://vine.co/v/b3wPth5Zngx

I fully plan on doing more with these but just wanted to get my play area up and online.

I also make no warranty that these things will work. The line and Kitt were working quite well and some of the others kind of were doing things but you should be aware that I suppose it could blow up or something. I'm going to try to blog up those two above with a bit more detail at some point, but feel free to explore and read and such.
